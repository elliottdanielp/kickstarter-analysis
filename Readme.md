# Kickstarter Analysis

### After having 86% of her play FEVER funded in under a month Louise has asked how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

As you can see in the following screen shot the months of May, June and July are the best months to launch a theater funding campaign. While the months of November and December trend to be the worst months to launch a theater funding campaign.

Now if look at the outcomes based on the campaign goal, we can see that goals that had been 
Set at $5,000 or less had the best outcomes with 70% to 75% of the campaigns meeting their goal. We can also see that 67% of the campaigns for the $35,000 to $44,999 also reached their goal’s.

Now why did Louise’s campaign fail? She held her campaign from June 13th through July 11th and with a goal of $2,885. Both of those variables tell us her campaign goal was in the most successful goal range along with her campaign being in one of the most successful months to run one. One reason why her campaign didn’t reach it’s goal would be the fact that she only ran her campaign for month, if she would of started her campaign in May and ran it through to the end of July her campaign would have had a better chance of being successful. 

That brings us to the downfall or limit’s of the data set. If we created a graph based on successful outcomes and how long they ran the campaign for we would be better able to pinpoint the most successful duration of campaigns. A percentage of successful campaigns compared to how long they ran for.
